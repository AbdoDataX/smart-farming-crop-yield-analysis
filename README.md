## 🧠 Key Insights

- ✅ **NDVI** (crop health) shows strong positive correlation with yield.
- 🌧️ **Rainfall** and **Soil Moisture** are critical for higher productivity.
- 💧 **Drip irrigation** consistently outperforms other irrigation methods.
- 🐛 High **PestInfestation** and **CropDisease** levels lead to lower yields.

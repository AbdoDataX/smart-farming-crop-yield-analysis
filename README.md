## 🎯 Project Goals

- Understand the key features influencing **crop yield**
- Explore the effect of **environmental factors** on agriculture
- Compare yield across different **irrigation methods**
- Visualize relationships between **NDVI, rainfall, soil, and yield**
- Build insights that can help improve **farming efficiency**

## 🧠 Key Insights

- ✅ **NDVI** (crop health) shows strong positive correlation with yield.
- 🌧️ **Rainfall** and **Soil Moisture** are critical for higher productivity.
- 💧 **Drip irrigation** consistently outperforms other irrigation methods.
- 🐛 High **PestInfestation** and **CropDisease** levels lead to lower yields.
